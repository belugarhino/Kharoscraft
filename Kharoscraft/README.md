# Kharoscraft

Welcome to *Kharoscraft*, a survival, building, and exploration game set in a unique world influenced by Kharoism. The game focuses on creating, crafting, and battling through an ever-changing world, filled with diverse creatures and mystical elements.

## Key Features:

- **Procedural World Generation**: Each world is unique, with random generation ensuring every playthrough offers fresh experiences.
- **Building & Crafting**: A block-based building system allows you to create your own structures. Infuse your creations with magical energies to enhance them.
- **Magic System**: The game includes a dynamic magic system, tied to the mystical energies that permeate the world. Craft enchanted equipment and discover powerful artifacts.
- **Creatures**: The world is populated with a variety of creatures, including divine beings, wildlife, and **Hollowed**â€”a race that attacks players on sight. These hostile creatures are a major component throughout the game, and you must face them to survive.
- **Hardcore Mode**: For an extra challenge, Hardcore Mode is available, where death is permanent, making every decision and encounter a matter of life and death.
